## API Endpoints

### Basic Operations
- `GET /basic/getPing`: Basic ping (unrestricted)
- `GET /basic/getSafePing`: Authenticated ping
- `POST /basic/setBearerToken`: Set new bearer token
- `GET /basic/getCurrentToken`: Get current bearer token
- `POST /basic/changeBearerToken`: Change bearer token

Note: Most endpoints require authentication with a bearer token.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in continious development mode and watches for file changes.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn eject`

This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you \`eject\`, you canâ€™t go back!**

### `yarn serve`

### CI/CD Process

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. The branches below may be present partially or completely.

- **Production Branch**: Code pushed to the `prod` branch will trigger the CI/CD pipeline, which will build and deploy the application to the production environment.
- **Staging Branch**: Code pushed to the `staging` branch will trigger the CI/CD pipeline, which will build and deploy the application to the staging environment.
- **Development Branch**: The `dev` branch is used for development purposes and does not trigger any CI/CD pipeline.

The CI/CD process is defined in the `.github/workflows` directory and includes steps such as checking out the repository, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies, building the project, creating a Docker image, and deploying it to the server.

**Environment Variables (GitHub Secrets and Variables)**:
- `ENVKEY_PORT`: Port number for the application [VAR]
- `INITIAL_BEARER_TOKEN`: Initial bearer token for authentication [VAR]
- `MAKEFILE_OVERWRITE_DOCKERNAME`: Docker name override [VAR]
- `REMOTE_HOST_TESTNET`: Staging server hostname (needed) [SECRET]
- `REMOTE_HOST_STAGING`: Staging server hostname (needed) [SECRET]
- `REMOTE_HOST_PROD`: Production server hostname (needed) [SECRET]
- `REMOTE_USERNAME`: SSH username for staging server (needed) [SECRET]
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: SSH private key for server access (needed) [SECRET]
- `REMOTE_PORT`: SSH port for staging server (needed) [SECRET]
